Each element is represented by a symbol (like H for hydrogen, O for oxygen, Fe for iron) and is arranged according to its atomic number and properties.\\n\\n**Key features to understand:**\\n\\n* **Atomic Number:** This is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.  It uniquely identifies each element.  Hydrogen (H) has an atomic number of 1, helium (He) has 2, and so on.  The atomic number increases as you move across the table from left to right.\\n\\n* **Atomic Mass (or Atomic Weight):**  This is the average mass of an atom of that element, taking into account the different isotopes (atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons).  You'll find this number below the element's symbol.\\n\\n* **Periods (Rows):**  The horizontal rows are called periods.  Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells (energy levels) surrounding their nucleus.\\n\\n* **Groups (Columns):**  The vertical columns are called groups or families.  Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell).  These valence electrons are the key players in chemical bonding.  For example, Group 18 (the noble gases) are all very unreactive because they have a full outermost electron shell.\\n\\n* **Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids:** The table is roughly divided into these three categories based on their properties.  Metals are typically shiny, conductive, and malleable; nonmetals are generally dull, poor conductors, and brittle; metalloids have properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals.\\n\\n* **Blocks (s, p, d, f):**  The elements are further categorized into blocks based on the electron orbitals where their valence electrons are located.
